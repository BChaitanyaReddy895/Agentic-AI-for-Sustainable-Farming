# 🌾 Agentic AI for Sustainable Farming

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

**Agentic AI for Sustainable Farming** is a multi-agent AI system designed to revolutionize agriculture by promoting collaboration between key stakeholders — farmers, weather stations, and agricultural experts. The project fosters sustainable farming practices through intelligent decision-making, optimized resource usage, and enhanced productivity.

## 🚀 Vision

With agriculture contributing significantly to global emissions and resource consumption, this project aims to:
- Reduce agriculture’s carbon footprint
- Optimize water and pesticide usage
- Combat soil erosion
- Promote farmer-friendly and sustainable practices

By 2050, global food demand is expected to rise by 50%. Our AI-driven approach equips farmers with the tools and insights needed to meet this demand sustainably.
